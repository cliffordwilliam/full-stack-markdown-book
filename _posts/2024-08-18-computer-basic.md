## Introduction

To code you use a computer, so you need to understand computer basics. Resources here are all from Goodwill Community Foundation (GCF), this is good for basics, you can read further after this lesson if you want to.

## Lesson overview

- Computer software and hardware.
- How to take screenshots.
- Importance of strong password.

Section from here on out are from outside sources.

## What is a computer

This section reference is [here](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/what-is-a-computer/1/)

Computer is a device that stores data in form of 1 and 0, by means of transistors. Everything from how remember how to do things and remember data is all stored in countless combinations of 1 and 0 in transistors. Transistors has 2 states that can be represented with 1 and 0. Then the 1 and 0 are used to make combination for storing data behaviour or raw data:

- Storing your user name, that is stored in 1 and 0.
- Knowing what to do when you move your mouse, it draws the mouse with relative offset to where you had displaced your mouse physically.

So everything from documents and emails are all made with 1 and 0.

### Hardware vs software

Hardware is the thing that we touch and see. Such as pressing on keyboards, sliding the mouse or looking at the monitor. Hardware is the physical part.

Software is the 1 and 0 data, electrics. When you click on an icon, the computer remembers instructions on how to react to that, like drawing a new window and so on. So when you interact with the hardware, the kernel software listens and then passes that to the other builtin software on top of it until it reaches to the highest layer where it draws thing on the monitor for you. Highest layer may be a built in thing or a software you installed from outside.

So you scroll down on mouse, web browser listens to that input, and offset the draw position of the html page that it recieves.

### What are the different types of computers?

Computers are not only desktops and laptops, it is anything with a hardware and software. So if you press the buttons on ATM machine and it does something then it is a computer. If you press something on a fridge and the screen changes that is also a computer. They come in many designs to for ease of use in different contexts.

#### Desktop computers

These are placed on desks. Parts are separarated and you have to assemble them. Computer case, monitor, keyboard and a mouse.

#### Laptop computers

These are battery powered and portable, it has all the parts inside of it.

#### Tablet computers

Same like laptop but remove the keyboard and mouse pad altogether with a touch-sensitive screen.

#### Servers

Just like any other computers but they only serve one purpose and that is to store and serve data. Meaning it can store pages from wikipedia, it is always on and no matter when you ask for a wikipedia page it will always listen and give it to you. And if someone adds a new page it will just store it and others can ask for it too.

#### Other types of computers

- Smartphones.
- Wearables.
- Game consoles.
- TVs.

### PCs and Macs

Personal computers are often found in two types. PC and Mac.

#### PCs

This starts from IBM PC in 1981. Other similar ones are called IBM PC Compatible. This is most common and has Microsoft Windows operating system by default.

#### Macs

Macintosh is from 1984, first widely sold computer with graphical user interface. All are made by Apple company. They mostly uses the Mac OS X operating system.

## What is an operating system?

This section reference is [here](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/)

Operating system is a software, it is made out of the kernel and other internal software that makes it possible for it to get input and draw things on the monitor. It manages memories and processes, also the additional softwares on it and how it can listen to your hardware inputs or output. All of this system is implemented so that you can easily store, get, delete or update data without having to talk to the kernel directly with 1 and 0 to. You can instead see the file manager visually without having to write commands to it, file manager is part of the operating system too, it handles data memory.

### Types of operating systems

Operating systems are mostly pre-loaded on bought computers. But you can change it if you want to. This is the most common 3 operating systems: Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux. How the operating system looks is due to how the desktop environment, a part of the operating system.

#### Microsoft Windows

Created in mid-1980s. There are different versions of it, it is the most popular one.

#### MacOS

macOS was known as OS X. All are made by Apple, preloaded in all Macintosh computers. According to [StatCounter Global Stats](http://gs.statcounter.com/). only 10% uses macOS, while windows is 80%. The reason for this is because Apple is more expensive.

#### Linux

This is a family of open-source operating systems. This can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. Windows is proprietary, meaning only the company can modify it. Linux is free and there are many distributions or versions that you can pick and choose. Only 2% uses Linux. But servers mostly all run Linux since it is easy to customize.

#### Operating systems for mobile devices

Mobile and phones uses different operating systems. Apple iOS and Google Android. These are not as fully features as desktop or laptops counterpart, they cannot run all of the softwares.

## What is an application?

This section reference is [here](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-applications/1/)

Applications are also knows as softwares or programs. These are sets of instruction made for a specific use. Meaning your browser and all of its features are just a collection of instructions written in code that works on top of your operating system, that is used for you to request html pages from servers over the net and see them drawn on the browser window. Desktop applications is the name used for computer softwares and mobile apps are what they call for mobile softwares.

Multi-tasking is when you run multiple software at the same time, this is possible and is handled all by your operating system.

### Desktop applications

Some are full features like Microsoft Word and others are simple like a clock or calendar.

#### Work processors

These are also known as rich text processor, these softwares remember how certain words are supposed to be drawn with colors and positions and more. Used for writing documents.

#### Web browsers

These are used for asking for resources like html pages or images to servers that are connected to the internet.

#### Media players

These are used to listen to music and videos, there are many types of these too. For more information, certain arrangements of 1 and 0 can form certain formats, certain formats are used to store different types of data from text to music, and to read or parse these data properly you need to use the right softwares. How your computer knows that file formats are certain files are is from their file name extension, so the names does not matter. It is there as a hint for your OS to know what software to recommend you to use to open it, the content remains the same.

#### Games

Games just takes in input and draw things correctly based on that. It is no different than a word processor, you type and letters appear. Then you can save documents just like how you can save in a game.

#### Mobile apps

Apps in mobile are all mostly available from the store, you can also use other means of installing apps to your phone too. Like Gmail, Instagram and Duolingo.

#### Installing new applications

You can install additional apps from external services like the app store or just websites online.

## Open source vs closed source software

This section reference is [here](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/basic-computer-skills/open-source-vs-closed-source-software/1/)

Apps are just collection of instructions, so there are people that has to write these instructions. These people are developers. The instructions are called source code. People or companies can make their own software and market them online or offline.

### What is open source and closed source?

Closed source softwares are also known as proprietary softwares. These source code cannot be accessed in any way of form by the public, only the company has access. While open source software has their source code open to the public where anyone who wants it can read, change however they want.

### Which type is more common?

Closed source. But there are always open source alternative to most closed ones. Like LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office.

### What are the pos and cons?

Open sources are free most of the time, bug fixes, new features and performance refactoring are faster since everyone around the globe can work on it. But it may not be as user friendly and if you ran into trouble there are almost no customer service to help you out.

Closed ones are more stable and focused products. Customer service is also available. But these ones usually costs money and if there are updates it takes a longer time to happen.

## Taking screenshots.

This section reference is [here](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/techsavvy/taking-screenshots/1/)

You need to do this to show others what your desktop is currently drawing, or what your screen looks like. Screenshot or screengrab feature is perfect for this, when words are not enough to describe something on the screen.

These are done with screenshot application or built in keyboard shortcut for your built in system to do it for you. You can take screenshot of your whole screen, certain window, and other options too. Here are ways to take screenshot in Windows, macOS and mobile.

### Taking scrrenshots in macOS

#### Using the Application

- From your desktop, click the Launchpad. This will bring you to your applications. The app you're looking for is called Screenshot. (If you don't see it right away, check in Other). 
- Once the application is in use, you'll see a toolbar pop up. You can choose from Capture Entire Screen, Capture Selected Window, and Capture Selected Portion mode. 
- If you want to take a picture of your entire screen, select this mode in the toolbar. Your mouse's arrow will turn into a camera icon. Click anywhere on the screen, and you'll hear the sound of a camera clicking.
- The screenshot will automatically save to your desktop. If you want to take another picture, you'll need to reopen the application.
- If you want to capture a selected portion of the screen, click this option in the toolbar. You can change the screenshot’s dimensions by clicking and dragging its corners.
- Once you’ve selected the portion you’d like to screengrab, click Capture in the toolbar. Once again, the screenshot will be saved to your desktop.

#### Using Keyboard Shortcuts

- Shift+Command+3: This takes a screenshot of the entire screen.
- Shift+Command+4: The mouse changes into a plus/crosshair icon.

Using the Shift+Command+4 shortcut, you can then choose from two options:
- Click and drag the plus/crosshair icon to take a screenshot of part of the screen.
- Press the space bar. The mouse changes into a camera icon. Then click on a window to take a screenshot of that window. 

### Taking screenshots in Windows

#### Using the Application

- Find the Snipping Tool or Snip & Sketch in your Applications. When you open the application, the screen will darken.
- In the application's toolbar, you have the option of taking a "Rectangular Snip," a "Free Form Snip,"  where you can draw the edges of your picture, a "Window Snip" in which you focus on a specific window, or a "Full Screen Snip." Let's say you want to take a Rectangular Snip.
- After clicking this option in the toolbar, click and drag the plus icon (or "crosshairs" icon), holding the left button on your mouse.
- Drag it across the area you'd like to screengrab. Upon release, a picture will be taken, and you can see it automatically in the application's preview.
- You can use the different editing functions in the toolbar, and click the Save button once you are finished. Select a name, file type, and the pathway where you will be saving your screenshot (like the desktop). 

#### Using Keyboard Shortcuts

- When taking a screenshot in Windows, you'll use the Print Scrn key in your keyboard shortcuts. The image will copy to the clipboard. It's important to note that only one image at a time can be copied to the clipboard.
- Print Scrn: This copies the entire screen.
- Alt+Print Scrn: This copies the active window or dialog box.
- Once you've taken a screenshot, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V to paste it into applications like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Paint, and Photoshop. You can then edit and save the image.

#### Taking screenshots on mobile devices

- To take a screenshot on newer Apple mobile devices, all you have to do is press the Volume up button and the Sleep/wake button at the same time. This will take a photo of what's on your screen, and the image will save to your camera roll (in the Photos app). If you have an older iPhone, you will hold the Home button and the Sleep/wake button at the same time.
- To take a screenshot on most Android mobile devices, just press the Volume Down button and the Power button at the same time. This will take a picture of your screen, and the image will save to your gallery.

## Creating strong passwords

This section reference is [here](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/techsavvy/password-tips/1/)

You will be making passwords all the time later on in the course so read this as it is important. There are risk to using passwords that are weak. You want long, strong and difficult for anyone to guess kind of password. Here are easy guides for you to follow.

### Why do I need a strong password?

Nothing is 100% secure, you yourself is a vulnerability in the system since you know your password in your head. Hacking or social engineering is when someone tries to get sensitive information from you or your machine. A strong password is the best defense you can have against this.

### Tips for creatng strong passwords

Strong ones are the ones where it is easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess.

- **Never use personal information**  
  Your own name or any other data related to you. These are publicly available online that people can use to find your password.
  
- **Use longer password**  
  At least 6 characters long, the longer the better.
  
- **Don't use the same password for each account**  
  If one of them was found out then your whole account is taken.
  
- **Include various characters**  
  Numbers, symbols, uppercase and lowercase letters and so on.

- **Do not use words that are found in dictionaries**  
  Like the word swimming and so on.
  
- **Random passwords are the strongest**  
  Use [password generator](http://strongpasswordgenerator.com/) to help you make one.

Examples of good passwords:
- chEwbAccAp!ZZa: does not have personal information and no common words, uses various characters and are random. Info are from general movies and not your personal one.
- p3MberLY%Av: more than 5 characters long, no personal info that is available publicly, uses nearby streetname like Pemberly Ave and not your current address.
- #eV$pIg&qf: hard to remember pattern, hacker have a hard time to guess this one. This is from a random password generator. Add mnemonic device to it too for easy memorization, like H=jNp2# could be HARRY = jessica NORTH paris 2 #, which is still random but with practice it is easier to memorize.
- Never use the same password twice for different accounts. Each account should have unique password.
- Use password manager, so you do not have to write it on paper, you instead store it online.
  - [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/)
  - [1Password](https://1password.com/)
  - [Google Chrome's password manager](http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95606)

 So remember to stay safe and secure with:
 - Use more than 10 characters.
 - Use variations of characters.
 - No personal information.
 - No common words.
