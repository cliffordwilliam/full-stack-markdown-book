## Introduction

Asking questions effectively is important in the technical side of things. You need to have a well formed question and provide as much context as possible to get the most out of asking question. You help others help you. Here are the ways to ask effective questions in a technical setting.

## Tips for getting the best help possible

### Always provide your code and the surrounding context

Provide as much context as possible like your code and error messages. Then point people into the specific issue like the line number or certain function. This avoid back and forth questions, which is frustrating and you get good helpful answer.

### Ask about the problem at hand, not the solution itself

Ask about the problem, not the solution. You figure the solution yourself, instead ask how to do a certain specific thing.

Ask how to do something rather than what is the answer is, you figure the solution yourself. You want to ask guidance and then you look for the answer yourself. Share what you have tried too, this helps others to not suggest a solution that you have tried and also let others work from somewhere rather than having to discuss the solution from 0.

It is fine to tell others that you are stuck. Then ask where you can research to get unstuck. Show others you pseudo code so they know your line of thought. All in all be able to research yourself.

### Don't take asking for more context to heart

Jangan masuk ati kalo orang nanya lebih detail.

Some things may seem obvious to you but most of the time it is not, so even the most trivial thing does have a significant impact on other things. This is because experts know a lot more on the small things that it does matter. So when people asks for more context just give it to them.

## Do not ask to ask, Just ask

Do not askÂ Any Java experts around? This is asking others to take responsibility because if they are mistaken they they are not an expert right. This is also bad since you filter out others from answering. And this is also lazy, if you are not willing to put in the work in asking then others will not put in the work to answering. Also being more explicit on what you are asking can attract interest from others that in turn invites more people to answer your question.

## XY Problem

This is when you ask for your attempted solution rather than the actual issue. Doing this wastes to much time and energy for everyone. Do not ask on how to do a certain solution that you come up with as others will find it odd rather just ask on the issue at hand. Because others will spend time trying to make your odd solution work only to realize that there is a more easier common solution to the real issue.

Do not get stuck thinking that the solution you think of is the one and only. Instead share the attempted solution and focus on the main issue.

## How to Ask Technical Question

### Before asking a question

#### Do your own research

Before asking do your own research and take time to prepare the question. The more time you invest the easier for others to help you.

### Prepare your question

#### 1.Provide code, pseudo-code, or other relevant information

Provide your pseudo-code:
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) for basic HTML/CSS/Javascript
- [Replit](https://replit.com/) for Javascript/Ruby
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) for Webpack/React
- [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for error messages or server output
- Provide screenshot when you can also. But do not tell others to download something to help you, downloading things are not something others want to do as it may be malicious.

#### 2. Explain the problem

Explain the issue and how to replicate the issue or bug consistently.

#### 4. Describe what you are expecting

Tell others what you expect or want to happen, and finally share what you have tried.

#### 5. Summarize what you have tried

Show your theory of what is happening, what you investigated, the results you had after trying different solutions, any findings during debugging, to pinpoint where the issue comes from.

### After Posting Your Question

Once someone answered do not ask follow up question you should start research instead. You have to put in effort and only then others will help you again. Basically others are just to guide you in the end you should stand on your own 2 feet.

Also by taking the time to prepare your detailed question most of the time you can solve your own issue as you are preparing. If this did happen you can add this to your readme.
