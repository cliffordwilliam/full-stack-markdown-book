## Introduction

Here we show you what you will setup in next lesson for your development environment. Here we do not use sandboxes, we use real development environment. You setup yourself and use it to write code yorself, this is a real world skill that you need.

## Lesson overview

Here we show you information only, you install things in next lesson. Double check what you type in next lesson to avoid headaches.

- Installing OS.
- Installing Google Chrome web browser.
- Installing a code editor.
- Creating an SSH key, a password that identify you to GitHub, and other sites.

If something goes wrong:

- Read terminal for any errors.
- Google.
- Ask Discord.

## OS options

### macOS

Good, we want Unix-based system.

### Linux (Ubuntu)

Open source operating system, works well with all prgramming language. Most developer tools are written to work natively with Linux. Your tools for Linux get updates often, more info on troubleshooting, runs better on Linux. Ubuntu distribution is most popular and user-friendly. Can use Xubuntu for light weight version. If you do not use Mac, use Linux.

### Windows

Not supported, because many tools were written for Linux. You have 3 options:

- VirtualBox Virtual Machine.
- Dual-boot Ubuntu installation.
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

Virtual machine emulates another computer in your computer, easy to setup but heavy and slow.

Dual-booting means storing 2 operating system in your machine. Boot to either one. Both OS uses all your machihe resources, faster operation, but it takes so much space with partition. May have low memory storage.

Windows Subsystem for Linux lets you use Linux in Windows, easy to setup, we use the version 2 of WSL AKA WSL2.

## Concerned about installing a new OS?

Using windows will make it really hard to install tools we need later on, this is because windows is designed to be user friendly. Linux is more like a frankenstein machine made out of non related parts made by random people across the globe, highly customizable. Here is why you want Linux:

- Looks good on your resume.
- Time spent wrestling with Windows is not worth it.
- Huge community support if things go wrong in Linux.
- Development tools are made for Linux, they run better on Linux.
- Work like the pros as most developer use Unix-based system, this is because most servers use Linux.
- Performance is way better in Linux, no bloats like window store or cortana. Linux takes smaller space and runs faster.
