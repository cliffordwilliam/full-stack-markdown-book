## Introduction

People who build and maintain websites are web developers, they work for clients to make web services. Their work is project and team focused. Clients are tech companies, organizations or government.

Web developer profession is suitable for those who like:
- Solving logical problems
- Building things
- Experimenting new technologies

Generally have good work-life balance and salary since everyone now needs websites.

## Types of web developers

Here you study to become a full-stack web developer. But there are 2 other types: front-end and back-end.

Front-end developer gets data from back-end, discuss with designer on how to present the data for excellent user experience, then code the buttons, cards and other component.

Back-end developer gets data from user, they design how to best organize the data for efficient and safe manipulation in the server. User password, salary, and other data.

Full-stack developer does both front and back-end.

## Types of careers

Here are the clients web developer works with:

1. **Large Tech Companies**: Google, Meta and so on have strict requirements. They offer good pay, benefits and opportunity.
2. **Startups**: Fast pace, lower salary and long hours but has unique environment and may offer equity.
3. **Freelancer**: Hourly wage with flexible schedule and you design your own product. You manage and find your own clients and bills.
4. **Web Consultancy**: Lower wage than freelancing but less hustle. Good work-life balance and pay.
5. **Older Companies**: Good work-life balance, pay and benefits at the cost of slower pace.

## Tools of the trade

Here are the basic web developer tools:
- Computer
- Google
- Text Editor
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Stack Overflow
- Git
- GitHub

## Motivation

Learning to code is difficult and you will need enjoyment in building things, problem solving and persistence to push through.

## Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard

This section reference is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230630111131/https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/)

Know your journey ahead here. This content is from hundreds of developers experience, it shows the common pitfalls they had falled into so that now you can avoid them all.

> ... was convinced that the seemingly normal programmers I ran into were actually sociopaths who had experienced, then repressed, the trauma of learning to code.

There are 4 phases, a phase is defined by the **required knowledge** and **resource density**.

You are only employable when your skill level and confidence level is both high.

![why_learning_to_code_is_so_damn_hard_tips]({{ "/assets/images/why_learning_to_code_is_so_damn_hard_tips.jpg" | relative_url }})

### Phase 1: The Hand-Holding Honeymoon

This phase has numerous resources but very small required knowledge.

Most resources are from "Learn to Code" movement like Codecademy. "Learn to Code" is a very high quality isolated environment that only teaches syntax but gives you too much confidence for your current skill level.

Things that you need to know here are the same regardless what your end goal is, it is just syntax.

Tips:
- Try different resources to see how you learn best and what projects interests you.
- Ignore anything about what you should learn, all is the same in this phase.
- Pick 1 resource that fits you and finish it.

### Phase 2: The Cliff of Confusion

This phase resources has a huge drop but has a huge jump in required knowledge.

Overconfidence people breaks here when they realized that they cannot do anything, most people gives up here. Some keeps going in hopes of getting better while debugging problems that you do not understand and thus not even know how to ask about it. The sign that you pass this phase is when you somehow have made some projects that actually works.

Here you need to learn how to read errors, when to use certain code. Like Phase 1 shows you how each chess pieces move with numerous resources, in Phase 2 you learn how to move them to attack, defense and so on with limited resources.

Tips:
- You have to build to learn, do not rely on tutorials. The real world does not have tutorials at work.
- Cooperate with someone else, this makes debugging easier.
- Learn from other`s code, learn why people do things the way they do and learn what is good and bad code.
- Do small projects constantly in this phase, your goal is experience.

### Phase 3: The Desert of Despair

This phase resources drops the most, but the required knowledge drops slightly.

This phase is long and pathless, there are many paths to take but you do not know which one to take to reach your goal to be a professional, most people falls into the wrong paths here and got lost. Thus why it is hard to measure progress.

Your goal here is to keep looking until you get a project to work as expected, these are your real projects and where you start to understand.

Tips:
- Have a strong goal, do not fall into mirages as you won`t get anywhere.
- Find a strong path to your goal, dig deep and spend time to validate the book or site if it does gets you there.
- Focus, do not get side tracked learning non related things in this phase.

### Phase 3: The Upswing of Awesome

This phase resources increases almost as much as the beginning and so does the required knowledge.

Here your Googling skill is excellent and you understand industry blog posts and screencasts. You are now deep in a framework and knows how to build a working app. But under the hood it is all duct tapes, you do not know what is bad and what is good about it. As you keep going to feel like a fraud, you feel like being a professional is still far but you will make it.

You need to fill in the knowledge holes to be professional and land a job.

Tips:
- Seek and follow best practices, find the best solution to make production ready code in real job setting.
- Never make assumptions on how things work, learn it and fill knowledge gap.
- Tackle the weak skills, things like testing and deployment that are rarely covered should be mastered to be professional.
- Get feedbacks, that is the only way you know how to write code that works in a professional teamwork setting:
  - Legible
  - Modular
  - Maintainable

Now you understand the road ahead and the tips on each phase.

## Wikipedia entry on web design

Making and maintaining website requires teams with different skills such as web graphic design, user interface design, user experience design, search engine optimization and much more. Website making combines design and engineering, they also need to adhere to the usability and web accessibility guidelines.

## Front-end, back-end and fullstack

Web developers have good job security because, as of June 2021 there are more than 1.8 billion website, now businesses all need websites to stay competitive and website building process changes rapidly. Thus it is good to know what positions are available for web developers. Employment is [projected to grow](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm) 8 percent between 2019 and 2029, faster than most occupations.

### What is a Front-End Developer?

They use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create instruction for browsers to draw a page with fonts, buttons and sliders that you can see and click on your screen. They also write instruction for page navigation.

### Skills and Tools Required for Front-End Development

They also need to know how to use frameworks and libraries, these are pre-written codes.

Here is an analogy. Front-end development is like building a Tamiya car. Framework is the pre-made car chassis and the page navigation instruction while library is the pre-made car motor and the Google sign-in form. You can make all that yourself or you can buy them

![front_end_back_end_and_fullstack_framework_nextjs]({{ "/assets/images/front_end_back_end_and_fullstack_framework_nextjs.jpg" | relative_url }})

Here are sites that uses the Next.js framework:
- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/)
- And so much more

There are times when you must use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Because you can make wild things that no framework can ever do:
- [wutheringwaves](https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main)
- These are rare

If you like having your work be drawn on the screen and you can interact with it, like making a video game, then front-end is suitable for you.

### How it Translates

The drawings, photos, texts, data are all from designers, photographers, copywriters, back-end developers. So front-end developer just take content and arrange them in a pleasing way for the eye and user experience.

### What is a Back-End Developer?

Back-end developer provides the data like the currently logged in user, the user account balance, or the number of visitor a user had and more to front-end where they arrange that in a card or button on a page. Data is stored in a similar way to an excel software.

Here is the flow in a nutshell:
1. Raw data are all stored in rented servers, the only responsibility it has is to just store data.
2. The data manipulation logic is stored in another rented computer, the only responsibility it has is to get and process data from server:
  - Logic consists of a finite amount of commands, like get all user or get a certain user with their blog posts, or add 1 new user and so on.
4. Front-end rented computer will ask the back-end logic for data, like get all user, then front-end will draw each user in a card.

Here is an analogy:
1. First we need to rent a storage to store the burger ingredients.
2. Then we need to rent a chef and teach him all of the recipe we have.
3. Then the front-end clerk will ask our chef to make a food on the recipe, clerk will arrange the food on the plate before giving it to the customer.

Note that you can make a front-end only app or back-end only app. Front-end only app data will only be remembered in your browser since you do not have back-end as persistent storage. So if you change the data, close the browser, the data will reset. Back-end only app will only serve you text, so you can ask it for data but you will only get texts like this in your browser:

```json
{
  "abilities": [
    {
      "ability": {
        "name": "limber",
        "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/7/"
      },
      "is_hidden": false,
      "slot": 1
    },
    {
      "ability": {
        "name": "imposter",
        "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/150/"
      },
      "is_hidden": true,
      "slot": 3
    }
  ],
}
```

Back-end developer use database languages and programming languages to create the finite commands to process data. They also have their own framework that provides commonly used commands. Back-end developer works together with business stakeholders to translate business logic into code logic, code logic.

If you like playing with excel, you will love back-end development.

### How it Translate

When you go to social media and see who followed you, the back-end developers are the ones responsible for creating data relationship binds between your account and your followers account.

### What is a Full Stack Developer?

Full-stack developer master both. This role was popularized by [Facebook engineering department](https://www.facebook.com/notes/10158791462547200/).

### Skills and Tools Required for Full Stack Developers

Full-stack now needs to know a all of things from both sides.

### How it Translate

They are responsible for both sides.

### The Bottom Line

Being a good developer is one thing but you also need soft skills, attention to detail, learn quickly, problem solving skills, business knowledge, good communication skills and more.
