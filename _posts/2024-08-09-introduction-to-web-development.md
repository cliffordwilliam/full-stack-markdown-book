## Introduction

People who build and maintain websites are web developers, they work for clients to make web services. Their work is project and team focused. Clients are tech companies, organizations or government.

Web developer profession is suitable for those who like:
- Solving logical problems
- Building things
- Experimenting new technologies

Generally have good work-life balance and salary since everyone now needs websites.

## Types of web developers

Here you study to become a full-stack web developer. But there are 2 other types: front-end and back-end.

Front-end developer gets data from back-end, discuss with designer on how to present the data for excellent user experience, then code the buttons, cards and other component.

Back-end developer gets data from user, they design how to best organize the data for efficient and safe manipulation in the server. User password, salary, and other data.

Full-stack developer does both front and back-end.

## Types of careers

Here are the clients web developer works with:

- **Large Tech Companies:**  
  Google, Meta and so on have strict requirements. They offer good pay, benefits and opportunity.

- **Startups:**  
  Fast pace, lower salary and long hours but has unique environment and may offer equity.

- **Freelancer:**  
  Hourly wage with flexible schedule and you design your own product. You manage and find your own clients and bills.

- **Web Consultancy:**  
  Lower wage than freelancing but less hustle. Good work-life balance and pay.

- **Older Companies:**  
  Good work-life balance, pay and benefits at the cost of slower pace.

## Tools of the trade

Here are the basic web developer tools:
- Computer
- Google
- Text Editor
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Stack Overflow
- Git
- GitHub

## Motivation

Learning to code is difficult and you will need enjoyment in building things, problem solving and persistence to push through.

## Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard

This section reference is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230630111131/https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/)

Know your journey ahead here. This content is from hundreds of developers experience, it shows the common pitfalls they had falled into so that now you can avoid them all.

> ... was convinced that the seemingly normal programmers I ran into were actually sociopaths who had experienced, then repressed, the trauma of learning to code.

There are 4 phases, a phase is defined by the **required knowledge** and **resource density**.

![why_learning_to_code_is_so_damn_hard_resource_density]({{ "/assets/images/why_learning_to_code_is_so_damn_hard_resource_density.jpg" | relative_url }})

![why_learning_to_code_is_so_damn_hard_required_knowledge]({{ "/assets/images/why_learning_to_code_is_so_damn_hard_required_knowledge.jpg" | relative_url }})

You are only employable when your skill level and confidence level is both high.

![why_learning_to_code_is_so_damn_hard_tips]({{ "/assets/images/why_learning_to_code_is_so_damn_hard_tips.jpg" | relative_url }})

### Phase 1: The Hand-Holding Honeymoon

This phase has numerous resources but very small required knowledge.

Most resources are from "Learn to Code" movement like Codecademy. "Learn to Code" is a very high quality isolated environment that only teaches syntax but gives you too much confidence for your current skill level.

Things that you need to know here are the same regardless what your end goal is, it is just syntax.

Tips:
- Try different resources to see how you learn best and what projects interests you.
- Ignore anything about what you should learn, all is the same in this phase.
- Pick 1 resource that fits you and finish it.

### Phase 2: The Cliff of Confusion

This phase resources has a huge drop but has a huge jump in required knowledge.

Overconfidence people breaks here when they realized that they cannot do anything, most people gives up here. Some keeps going in hopes of getting better while debugging problems that you do not understand and thus not even know how to ask about it. The sign that you pass this phase is when you somehow have made some projects that actually works.

Here you need to learn how to read errors, when to use certain code. Like Phase 1 shows you how each chess pieces move with numerous resources, in Phase 2 you learn how to move them to attack, defense and so on with limited resources.

Tips:
- You have to build to learn, do not rely on tutorials. The real world does not have tutorials at work.
- Cooperate with someone else, this makes debugging easier.
- Learn from other's code, learn why people do things the way they do and learn what is good and bad code.
- Do small projects constantly in this phase, your goal is experience.

### Phase 3: The Desert of Despair

This phase resources drops the most, but the required knowledge drops slightly.

This phase is long and pathless, there are many paths to take but you do not know which one to take to reach your goal to be a professional, most people falls into the wrong paths here and got lost. Thus why it is hard to measure progress.

Your goal here is to keep looking until you get a project to work as expected, these are your real projects and where you start to understand.

Tips:
- Have a strong goal, do not fall into mirages as you won't get anywhere.
- Find a strong path to your goal, dig deep and spend time to validate the book or site if it does gets you there.
- Focus, do not get side tracked learning non related things in this phase.

### Phase 3: The Upswing of Awesome

This phase resources increases almost as much as the beginning and so does the required knowledge.

Here your Googling skill is excellent and you understand industry blog posts and screencasts. You are now deep in a framework and knows how to build a working app. But under the hood it is all duct tapes, you do not know what is bad and what is good about it. As you keep going to feel like a fraud, you feel like being a professional is still far but you will make it.

You need to fill in the knowledge holes to be professional and land a job.

Tips:
- Seek and follow best practices, find the best solution to make production ready code in real job setting.
- Never make assumptions on how things work, learn it and fill knowledge gap.
- Tackle the weak skills, things like testing and deployment that are rarely covered should be mastered to be professional.
- Get feedbacks, that is the only way you know how to write code that works in a professional teamwork setting:
  - Legible
  - Modular
  - Maintainable

Now you understand the road ahead and the tips on each phase.

## Wikipedia entry on web design

This section reference is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design)

Making and maintaining website requires teams with different skills such as web graphic design, user interface design, user experience design, search engine optimization and much more. Website making combines design and engineering, they also need to adhere to the usability and web accessibility guidelines.

## Front-end, back-end and fullstack

This section reference is [here](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2020/12/front-end-vs-back-end-vs-full-stack-web-developers.html)

Web developers have good job security because, as of June 2021 there are more than 1.8 billion website, now businesses all need websites to stay competitive and website building process changes rapidly. Thus it is good to know what positions are available for web developers. Employment is [projected to grow](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm) 8 percent between 2019 and 2029, faster than most occupations.

### What is a Front-End Developer?

They use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create instruction for browsers to draw a page with fonts, buttons and sliders that you can see and click on your screen. They also write instruction for page navigation.

### Skills and Tools Required for Front-End Development

They also need to know how to use frameworks and libraries, these are pre-written codes.

Here is an analogy. Front-end development is like building a Tamiya car. Framework is the pre-made car chassis and the page navigation instruction while library is the pre-made car motor and the Google sign-in form. You can make all that yourself or you can buy them

![front_end_back_end_and_fullstack_framework_nextjs]({{ "/assets/images/front_end_back_end_and_fullstack_framework_nextjs.jpg" | relative_url }})
![front_end_back_end_and_fullstack_framework_clerk]({{ "/assets/images/front_end_back_end_and_fullstack_framework_clerk.jpg" | relative_url }})

Here are sites that uses the Next.js framework:
- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/)
- And so much more

There are times when you must use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Because you can make wild things that no framework can ever do:
- [wutheringwaves](https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main)
- These are rare

If you like having your work be drawn on the screen and you can interact with it, like making a video game, then front-end is suitable for you.

### How it Translates

The drawings, photos, texts, data are all from designers, photographers, copywriters, back-end developers. So front-end developer just take content and arrange them in a pleasing way for the eye and user experience.

### What is a Back-End Developer?

Back-end developer provides the data like the currently logged in user, the user account balance, or the number of visitor a user had and more to front-end where they arrange that in a card or button on a page. Data is stored in a similar way to an excel software.

Here is the flow in a nutshell:
1. Raw data are all stored in rented servers, the only responsibility it has is to just store data.
2. The data manipulation logic is stored in another rented computer, the only responsibility it has is to get and process data from server:
  - Logic consists of a finite amount of commands, like get all user or get a certain user with their blog posts, or add 1 new user and so on.
4. Front-end rented computer will ask the back-end logic for data, like get all user, then front-end will draw each user in a card.

Here is an analogy:
1. First we need to rent a storage to store the burger ingredients.
2. Then we need to rent a chef and teach him all of the recipe we have.
3. Then the front-end clerk will ask our chef to make a food on the recipe, clerk will arrange the food on the plate before giving it to the customer.

Note that you can make a front-end only app or back-end only app. Front-end only app data will only be remembered in your browser, so if you change the data, close the browser, the data will reset. Back-end only app will only serve you text, so you can ask it for data but you will only get texts like this in your browser:

[back-end only app](https://pokeapi.co/)

[front-end only app](https://pokedex.org/)

```json
{
  "abilities": [
    {
      "ability": {
        "name": "limber",
        "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/7/"
      },
      "is_hidden": false,
      "slot": 1
    },
    {
      "ability": {
        "name": "imposter",
        "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/150/"
      },
      "is_hidden": true,
      "slot": 3
    }
  ],
}
```

Back-end developer use database languages and programming languages to create the finite commands to process data. They also have their own framework that provides commonly used commands. Back-end developer works together with business stakeholders to translate business logic into code logic, code logic.

If you like playing with excel, you will love back-end development.

### How it Translate

When you go to social media and see who followed you, the back-end developers are the ones responsible for creating data relationship binds between your account and your followers account.

### What is a Full Stack Developer?

Full-stack developer master both. This role was popularized by [Facebook engineering department](https://www.facebook.com/notes/10158791462547200/).

### Skills and Tools Required for Full Stack Developers

Full-stack need to know both sides.

### How it Translate

They are responsible for both sides.

### The Bottom Line

Being a good developer is one thing but you also need soft skills, attention to detail, learn quickly, problem solving skills, business knowledge, good communication skills and more.

## Quora: How can I Become a Really Good Web Developer?

This section reference is [here](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/How-can-I-become-a-really-good-Web-Developer-starting-from-now-at-age-20-before-age-25)

### Do not do it for the wrong reason

Do not become a web developer because you want to be an entrepreneur. Do it because you enjoy it and have a passion for it. Because pretty salary marks and good cultures are not given perks, if you do it for money you will not be happy.

### Wanting to make a career in web development

You do not have to be a web developer to have a career in web development, you can be a WordPress developer to make small blogs, or you can be an entrepenuer that runs a company that makes huge online services.

### Where you fit in

Web development is complex and so see the big picture and decide where do you want to be in, WordPress developer? Full-stack? Entreprenuer? If you want to be a web developer you can start in front-end and pick your way up to either a senior front-end or back-end developer.

### Where should you start?

If you want to be a web developer:

- **Get involved in the community:**  
  Use RRS reader and add Jeffrey Zeldman, Molly Holzschlag, Jeremy Keith, Eric Meyer, Bryan Veloso, Jason Kottke, Ben Alman, Paul Irish, Rebecca Murphy, Jonathan Snook. Follow them on Twitter and their suggested users. Talk to them, read their posts, make comments.

- **But up some books and read:**  
   Get ePub books because physical technology books get outdated fast. Books like this one you are reading gets updated online for free. Here are some front-end books:
   - [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) (free version available)
   - [Bulletproof Web Design](http://www.simplebits.com/publications/bulletproof/)
   - [A Book Apart Series](http://www.abookapart.com/)
   - [O'Reilly books](http://oreilly.com/css-html/index.html)

- **Practice, challenge yourself and work for other people:**  
   Remake existing sites for fun or do non profit work for experience. Doing challenging things like this is the only way for you to grow. Never oversell yourself to clients as unhappy clients upsets everyone including your resume and reputation.

## Quora: What makes a great web developer?

This section reference is [here](http://www.quora.com/What-makes-a-great-web-developer)

   Is not tied down to anything. Knows how to use the right tools.
    
- **Separation of concerns:**  
  Writes readable and organized code.

Overall, best web developers has great knowledge and interest of things around web development too. Like user experience and search engine optimization.

## Jared the Nerd: What makes a good Developer?

This section reference is [here](http://jaredthenerd.com/2013/05/What-Makes-A-Good-Developer/)

Employers look for web developer applicants (from juniors to mid-levels to seniors) that performs well, happy while working, and who are **excited**. Juniors, mid-levels and seniors are aall excited about different things.

### Good Junior Developers

They are excited about making things, websites, desktop apps, anything. They are excited about learning new things, solving problems and designing solutions. They provide enery to the team, and other more expericed developer acts as anchor to teach them.

### Good Mid-Level Developers

They have more things that excite them, they find new ways of using old tools. They focus more on the big picture business problems (web developer focus on solving problems, not code). They underestimate how long things will take and dive down into rabbit holes. Senior developers keeps them in check, stops them from using old tools in odd ways, telling them how long things will take realistically and pull them out of rabbit holes (AKA overdoing things).

### Good Senior Developers

They provide directions on where to go. Because they had experience and knows the danger up ahead. They find the right solution, teach the juniors, keeps the mid-levels in check from bloating the app.

### Conclusion

Good developers are always excited about making things and solving problems.

## FreeCodeCamp: Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me When I Was Learning How To Code

This section reference is [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code-565fc9dcb329/)

### Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code

You need to have a goal to motivate you. Make website, games, apps, startup business, automate everyday task, improve resume, pass a course, anything.

### There's nothing mystical about it

Coding is like learning how to sculpt, there are rules and proper ways to do things. There are techniques, tools, best practices that people had made over the time. There is no such thing as you are not smart enough to code, because coding is as complicated as you make it to be. If you want to make the most complicated thing ever code lets you do that. But good apps does not have to be complicated at all.

### It never works the first time or second or third

Web developer career is just like any other career, everyday you face new problems, see new error messages to decipher. From junior to seniors we all face this everyday. The only difference is that senior developers have more faith that whatever error they face there is a logical explanation behind it that they can learn to understand. Juniors tend to get intimidated when they see errors.

### Someone will always tell you you're doing it wrong

Use tabs, not indent, do not comment code, use comments, do not listen to these and just follow the preferred way that most people do and you are okay. The one true path does not exists, there are only preferences. If someone in your workplace later on tells you to do things in certain way, see if that is what the whole company is doing (the style guide that they adhere to), if not then ignore them.

### Someone will always tell you you're not a real coder

Just use the right tool to build the cool things that people love (no one cares what tool you used to build it). If someone tells you that real programmers know C, who cares. The reason why people have this mentality is the fear that the programmer title will be meaningless if there is no gate keeping. Use the tools you are happy with, as you get better you naturally move on to something like C.

### Worrying about "geek cred" will slowly kill you

Who cares about this, spend time actually getting better at programming rather than worrying if you fit in with the geeks or tech communities. Fitting into anything has nothing to do with being a good programmer.

### Sticking with it is more important than the method

No matter what beginner tutorial online you graduated from. The next tutorials usually already expects you to have a high knowledge in programming. The only way to jump the gap is preseverance, be consistent is learning and building things. Even if you barely understand the first time keep at it as one day it will click.

## TechCrunch: Don't Believe Anyone who Tells you Learning to Code is Easy

This section reference is [here](http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/24/dont-believe-anyone-who-tells-you-learning-to-code-is-easy/)

It is not easy.

Tip, never immediately follow a guide when you have not read the whole thing first. Because what can happen is that in the middle of the guide you will find out that the whole thing is for an older version and now you have no idea how to undo the things you have done, and it may cause problems to your machine. So verify thoroughly that the guide is up to date and then follow it precisely, then note down what you had done (that online guide may be taken down) so you keep track on the things you had done to your machine (or you can tell others how you did what you did).

Most people see programming as a clean thing, but it is a actually a very messy job. Programming work flow is messy and sometimes even frustrating. Programming is about knowing how to ask the right question, knowing how to Google properly, knowing what to copy and paste. There is no mastery as well, no matter how much you study or practice the master ceilling does not exist. At any skill level in your career you will always feel lost and stupid because there are limitless of things to learn. New trendy technologies appears frequently and you have to keep up to stay relevant in the job market or business, this is the never ending learning that will make you feel stupid every time you learn them.

Here is a Recursive Recipe for Learning to Program:

1. **Follow tutorials step by step:**  
  Follow blindly, just like Hunter S. Thompson. Goal is to get a feel for how things are done in this new framework/language.

2. **Rebuild the thing you just made or a slight variation of it:**  
  Do not use the tutorial as much, find out what you do not know.

3. **Try to build something simple that you actually want to make:**  
  Do not use the tutorial at all and build what you want, again find out what you do not know.
  
4. **Go back to step 1:**  
   Find a new tutorial and repeat step 1 until you understand what you do not know.

Once you have done this stumbling around frustrating grind, you start to see the pattern and can now learn faster. Do not stress about learning everything on day 1, keep track of what you do not know and learn them 1 by 1.

## Code Quizzes: Deliberate Programming Practice

This section reference is [here](https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2013/04/28/deliberate-programming-practice/)

Peter Norvig [Teach Yourself Programming In Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) article cited Malcolm Gladwell finding that it takes 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to reach mastery. Do note that office hours are not deliberate practice. Deliberate practice means reading a new book, learning a new language, learning a new course, solving a new challenging problem. Deliberate practice stretches your brain as you do something beyond your current skill level, you want to keep pushing your skill level higher are the ones that are successful. Most of this happen outside of work as someone with 10 years of experiecne in an office work only has 1 year worth of deliberate practice since the rest of the time are just repetitive work.

Today web developer deliberate practice would look like this, first understand how to use a libary or framework, then learn how to do that without library or framework, then create your own framework. You want to keep digging down as far as you need to in order to increase your skill level. Know that it is impossible to learn them all and yet you still have to keep going anyways, that is how to be an expert.
