## Introduction

People who build and maintain websites are web developers, they work for clients to make web services. Their work is project and team focused. Clients are tech companies, organizations or government.

Web developer profession is suitable for those who like:
- Solving logical problems
- Building things
- Experimenting new technologies

Generally have good work-life balance and salary since everyone now needs websites.

## Types of web developers

Here you study to become a full-stack web developer. But there are 2 other types: front-end and back-end.

Front-end developer gets data from back-end, discuss with designer on how to present the data for excellent user experience, then code the buttons, cards and other component.

Back-end developer gets data from user, they design how to best organize the data for efficient and safe manipulation in the server. User password, salary, and other data.

Full-stack developer does both front and back-end.

## Types of careers

Here are the clients web developer works with:

1. **Large Tech Companies**: Google, Meta and so on have strict requirements. They offer good pay, benefits and opportunity.
2. **Startups**: Fast pace, lower salary and long hours but has unique environment and may offer equity.
3. **Freelancer**: Hourly wage with flexible schedule and you design your own product. You manage and find your own clients and bills.
4. **Web Consultancy**: Lower wage than freelancing but less hustle. Good work-life balance and pay.
5. **Older Companies**: Good work-life balance, pay and benefits at the cost of slower pace.

## Tools of the trade

Here are the basic web developer tools:
- Computer
- Google
- Text Editor
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Stack Overflow
- Git
- GitHub

## Motivation

Learning to code is difficult and you will need enjoyment in building things, problem solving and persistence to push through.

## Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard

This section reference is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230630111131/https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/)

Know your journey ahead here. This content is from hundreds of developers experience, it shows the common pitfalls they had falled into so that now you can avoid them all.

> ... was convinced that the seemingly normal programmers I ran into were actually sociopaths who had experienced, then repressed, the trauma of learning to code.

There are 4 phases, a phase is defined by the **required knowledge** and **resource density**.

You are only employable when your skill level and confidence level is both high.

### Phase 1: The Hand-Holding Honeymoon

This phase has numerous resources but very small required knowledge.

Most resources are from "Learn to Code" movement like Codecademy. "Learn to Code" is a very high quality isolated environment that only teaches syntax but gives you too much confidence for your current skill level.

Things that you need to know here are the same regardless what your end goal is, it is just syntax.

Tips:
- Try different resources to see how you learn best and what projects interests you.
- Ignore anything about what you should learn, all is the same in this phase.
- Pick 1 resource that fits you and finish it.

### Phase 2: The Cliff of Confusion

This phase resources has a huge drop but has a huge jump in required knowledge.

Overconfidence people breaks here when they realized that they cannot do anything, most people gives up here. Some keeps going in hopes of getting better while debugging problems that you do not understand and thus not even know how to ask about it. The sign that you pass this phase is when you somehow have made some projects that actually works.

Here you need to learn how to read errors, when to use certain code. Like Phase 1 shows you how each chess pieces move with numerous resources, in Phase 2 you learn how to move them to attack, defense and so on with limited resources.

Tips:
- You have to build to learn, do not rely on tutorials. The real world does not have tutorials at work.
- Cooperate with someone else, this makes debugging easier.
- Learn from other`s code, learn why people do things the way they do and learn what is good and bad code.
- Do small projects constantly in this phase, your goal is experience.

### Phase 3: The Desert of Despair

This phase resources drops the most, but the required knowledge drops slightly.

This phase is long and pathless, there are many paths to take but you do not know which one to take to reach your goal to be a professional, most people falls into the wrong paths here and got lost. Thus why it is hard to measure progress.

Your goal here is to keep looking until you get a project to work as expected, these are your real projects and where you start to understand.

Tips:
- Have a strong goal, do not fall into mirages as you won`t get anywhere.
- Find a strong path to your goal, dig deep and spend time to validate the book or site if it does gets you there.
- Focus, do not get side tracked learning non related things in this phase.

### Phase 3: The Upswing of Awesome

This phase resources increases almost as much as the beginning and so does the required knowledge.

Here your Googling skill is excellent and you understand industry blog posts and screencasts. You are now deep in a framework and knows how to build a working app. But under the hood it is all duct tapes, you do not know what is bad and what is good about it. As you keep going to feel like a fraud, you feel like being a professional is still far but you will make it.

You need to fill in the knowledge holes to be professional and land a job.

Tips:
- Seek and follow best practices, find the best solution to make production ready code in real job setting.
- Never make assumptions on how things work, learn it and fill knowledge gap.
- Tackle the weak skills, things like testing and deployment that are rarely covered should be mastered to be professional.
- Get feedbacks, that is the only way you know how to write code that works in a professional teamwork setting:
  - Legible
  - Modular
  - Maintainable

Now you understand the road ahead and the tips on each phase.
