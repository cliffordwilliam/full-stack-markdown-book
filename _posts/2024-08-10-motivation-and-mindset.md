## Introduction

To learn anything you need the right mindset, time and effort. Here we discuss the things to do and avoid when studying.

## Motivation

You need motivation to study, it can be anything.

- You need a job.
- You want to make apps.
- You want to start your own company.

Use your motivation to as fuel and end goal for studying.

## Growth mindset

Mindset is key to studying anything. **Fixed mindset** people believe when they fail once, they never will. But research says that intelligence can be developed. **Growth mindset** people believes that with effort and persistence you can learn anything. Does not matter how long you persist, you will make it, that is learning. Always remember your milestones as a proof that it is possible to improve. Some people do it faster and some does it slower, it does not matter, this is because we all have different backgrounds and ways of thinking. Some are better suited for detailed oriented sort of thinking while others are more abstract and so on.

## The learning process

The best way to learn is to apply new concept into practice in form of projects. This ensures that your understanding is correct and is aligned to reality.

When learning, your mind will constantly switch between focus mode and diffuse mode. **Focus mode** is when you do stretch your brain in deliberate learning. **Diffuse mode** is when your brain connects neuron in your brain when you are relaxing, which result in learning new knowledge. It is similar to exercising, you lift weigh that causes your muscle to break, you rest and lets it heal, then your muscle recover stronger. So when you are at your limit maximum effort, take breaks.

Then lastly, to test your understanding, go and teach someone this new thing you just learned. This will reveal knowledge holes that you missed.

## What to do when you're stuck

Here are tips when you are really stuck:

- **Google it:**  
  The reason is because it is very likely that whatever problem you are facing now, someone had solved it in the past.

- **Take a break:**  
  Enter diffuse mode and let your brain heal.

- **Ask for help in the [TOP Discord server](https://discord.gg/theodinproject):**  
  Or ask anyone else online about it. The next lesson will show you how to ask question effectively and properly so read that first.

Here is an algorithm flow to help you get unstuck:

## A note on AI code generation

Today we have Large Language Models and generative AIs. Github Copilot code completion and ChatGPT code generation. Beginners should avoid this as it creates huge knowledge holes, those who already understand how to program and just wants an assistant to help them write should use this. David Humphrey, a computer science professor, [wrote about ChatGPT and its potentially negative impacts on core learning](https://blog.humphd.org/cheatgpt/).

Pitfalls for beginners:

1. You do not get to learn how your code works under the hood.
2. Missed out practicing asking good questions.
3. Missed out practicing about talking about your code, this is needed at work for code reviews.
4. You do not know what is good and bad code. Text from LLMs needs to be reviewed closely, they can hallucinate.
5. Writing good prompts is not a core skill of a web developer.
6. LLM purpose is to provide answer, not teach you (for now).
7. With all the above, interviews will be a struggle. Interviews will not let you use AI tools.

## Managing your study time

Daily consistency is key, even if you do it 1 hour a day. Do not make deadlines for yourself, do not rush and instead go at your own pace and spend enough time to understand something completely before moving on, or you will have knowledge holes and be a poor web developer.

## Pitfalls to avoid

Here are some pitfalls and how to avoid them:

- **Procrastination:**  
  Do [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Study and do not get distracted for 25 minutes, if you fail, restart that 25 minutes. If you succeed, take 5 minutes break. Then repeat. After 4 reps take 15 minutes break. This forces you to work and not procrastinante, since 25 minutes is a very short time to focus and learn.

- **Not taking breaks:**  
  Pushing yourself too hard leads to burnout. You instead get more done with regular breaks. Studies show that performance increase after breaks of all duration. John Trougakos, Associate Professor of Management at the University of Toronto, says concentration is like a muscle. Focus gets fatigue and needs rest. During breaks you can:
  - Listen to music.
  - Journal.
  - Meditate.
  - Play a quick game.
  - Go for a walk.

  Read this for [more information on breaks & productivity](https://simpleprogrammer.com/taking-breaks-will-boost-productivity/)

- **Digital distractions:**  
  Social medias are time waster, they break focus and causes procrastination. So turn them off.

- **Physical distractions:**  
  TV in background or people talking does the same damage as above. Find a quiet place to study.

- **Rabbit holes:**  
  Do not spend too much time to learn them all. Learn what you need, take note of what is there to learn for later when you need it. Rabbit holes causes burnout and destroys momentum.
  
- **Comparing yourself to others:**  
  Who cares where others are, compare yourself to your past, what matters is if you are now better than yesterday.

- **Counterproductive note-taking:**  
  Do not take notes as all notes you need have been written online. Instead write the resources name that you need so that you can visit them later online when you need it. Or notes on learning to do list.

## Conclusion

Learning is challenging, use this page as a way to help you learn anything you want. The sections below uses external sources, it is all from Odin Project references. But I do believe that no everyone can study anything they want. No matter how much effort they put into it there are other factors at play for one to study and master something.

## Outiside sources

Sections from here on out are from outside sources.

## Believe you can get better

This secion reference is [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve)

In a high school in Chicago, when students failed a course they got the grade "Not Yet". The grade "Not Yet" focuses on the process rather than the result. Some people had growth mindset and others have fixed mindset. People with growth mindset sees challenges as an opportunity to improve their skillls. While people with fixed mindset sees it as an opportunity to show everyone that they are dumb. We need to have the right prespective where challenges are a good thing, you want to do it so you can improve. Kids from a yound age cheats in school for two reasons, some cheats because they had to take care of their family (no time to study) while others cheat because they know that there is no point in putting effort because they cannot do it. No matter how long it takes it is possible for anyone to study any skill. To make people have the growth mindset we have to explicitly encourage that the process is more important that the result. So praise the effort they put into the process for solving a hard maths question rather than the correct answer. Tell them that when you strain your brain you make stronger neuron connections that increases your skills. Growth mindset is the believe that if you keep at it you will make it no matter how long it take.

## Grit

This section reference is [here](https://ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)

Passion, stamina, motivation and preseverance for sticking with your long term goals daily for years, like a marathon you put your all in every step. This is the key to be successful in anything. What makes a sales man outperform their peers? What makes a soldier do better that the rest? What makes a teacher be the best in their campus? It is Grit. This is a thing that is unrelated to anything else, not talent or IQ. Grit is created from growth mindset. An idea developed at Standford University by Carol Dweck.

## You can learn anything

This section reference is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O96fE1E-rf8)

We all start at 0, cannot talk or walk or anything. Einstein started not knowing how to count to 10. But we all learn, failing and succeeding, rinse and repeat, each time you get stronger and you keep going knowing that you can improve. Everything in the world is based on something simple that anyone can understand. You can learn anything.

## Coursera's learning how to learn course

This section reference is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O96fE1E-rf8)

Diffuse mode is like when you go to the toilet or sleep, you are not thinking of the problem but when you do come back to focus mode new connections are available in your brain neurons that gives you new prespective and angle to solve the issue.

People procrastinnate because it is a normal reaction, when you have a task ahead of you that requires effort, the brain does feel physical pain. You can choose to push through and the pain will ebb away in a minute or two but most people decided to run away and do other things. This is because it is way easier to go to an existing connection in your brain rather than trying to make new ones. iF you keep doing this in your life you do will get into trouble in life.

If you have issues remembering things there is a chance that you are more creative, because you have many ideas when you hear certain things it is difficult to hold what was told and the ideas you had. If you study slower you have an advantage of having a deeper understanding and solid foundation than those who study fast. People who study fast tends to make assumptions and jump to conclusion. Tests are the best for studying, this is why there is homeworks, you need to keep doing it multiple times like how you sing a song multiple times to the point where it flows well in your mind. Look at a page and look away and recall what you just read. This enhances your connection stronger in your brain. Understanding needs to be combined with application to gain mastery.

## Becoming a TOP Success Story

This section reference is [here](https://dev.to/theodinproject/becoming-a-top-success-story-mindset-3dp2)

### A TOP Strategy Guide

Here are strategies that successful students had used in TOP. Covers both hard and soft skills.

### Mindset

#### Get Gritty

Here is a [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)) about grit personality trait.

#### Take the time you need

Never rush, rush causes burnout.

### The Discord Server

TOP community is best resource. Find help there, get advice. Understand goals, policies and procedures of the community.

#### Rules and FAQ

Read all the server rules. Read FAQ. It is taken seriously in server to keep professionalism. To make things fair for everyone from around the globe. This prevents misunderstanding and keeps chat friendly.

#### Culture

Study how people interact there before posting. They are forgiving and it is ok not to fit in. Everyone is there to help. Tricks for new comers:
- Assume positive intent, since tone is lost in text messages. Never assume attacks from others especially when English is not their 1st language.
- Cool down when upset before asking, hard to assume positive intent when you are upset. Plus no one wants to deal with you when you are upset.
- Terse messages are not attacks, people send short messages for efficiency.
- Bot commands is an ok way to communicate. Never assume as attacks. The intention is to remind you on an article to safe time.
- Be professional and respectful:
  - No random memes.
  - Reacts positively not toxic.
  - Reply in timely manner.
  - Do not jump to convo that does not concern you.
  - Do not say things to make others uncomfy.
  - Colleagues first then friends.
  - Use proper grammar.

#### Questions

Next lesson will cover more on how to ask questions, but here is a short coverage on how to ask.

- **Be available:**  
  Figure out every little detail, which one confuses you and use a debugger.

- **Wait:**  
  Wait around 30 min before asking questions again if no one answered. If no one answers again it is because your question is not effective. Or maybe no one is around to answer during that time. Do not waste people time with bad question.
  
- **Ask in proper channel:**  
  Do not speak over others. Post all of your code when asking a question. GitHub repo or repl.it, codepen, codesandbox and so on. Issue can also be in the context and not in the code itself.
  
- **Try to recreate:**  
  Try to recreate the error in a small isolated env, helps you frame question better this way too. And helps you fix your own issue too.
  
- **Thank the people:**  
  Thank the people helping, people will remember you this way.
  
- **Help others:**  
  Help others too to improve yourself too, improve communication.

Here is a summary from a [guide from Gordon Zhu](https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603) for asking questions.

Follow these steps to be good at asking questions. Asking good question is important, good question means you get faster answers from others that are more frequent and better. They get taken more seriously and get more respect, matters for your career. Good question saves time, no frustration no conflict, no back-and-forth conversation. You get far in career as people like to work with you, you do not get fired.

1. **Understand your code as best as you can:**  
  Figure out every little detail, which one confuses you and use a debugger.

2. **Clearly describe the problem:**  
  Explain context, provide URL, share what you are trying to do, provide timestamp, share where you get stuck. Explain the steps needed to consistently reproduce the problem, clicked 3 buttons in specific order? Works in chrome but not safari? Explain what you expect to see. Explain what you see, share the entire error message, share the line that made the error, weird UI bug? Share the screenshot.

3. **Provide the code to show the issue:**  
  Isolate the broken part and share that. Do not change the code as someone looks at it.

4. **Make sure the code you shared can reproduce the issue:**  
  Make sure how you descibe is accurate to how reality is in code. That is the only way someone can help you.

5. **Format code consistently:**  
  Keep style consistent, so that it is easy to read.

6. **Check typos:**  
  Stuck? Go back to where it worked and redo from there. For each small addition check if it is still working to find where it does not work. Find typo yourself, do not waste someone else's time to fix typo.

7. **Explain what you did to troubleshoot:**  
  List hypotheses about the cause then test each one, for each one list down what your attempted solution was. You should figure out the issue yourself by doing this.

8. **Explain what you think the problem is:**  
  Provide best guess on what issue is based on step 7.

9. **Proofread your question:**  
  Makes sure you have provided everything. Edit wording for clarity and not confusing. No typo in question as that makes people think you have typo in code.

10. **Send updates and remember that this is not your last question:**  
  Tell people if you had figured the solution as to not waste others time solving a solved solution. Take time and understand what someone is trying to say to you, they might not be right and verify if their solution works. Thank each person that helped.

11. **The Mindset:**  
  The mindset refers to the understanding that asking question is a burden. So you want to have put 100% effort in trying to solve your issue and only ask as a last resort. This makes people happy because you do not dump 100% of the burden to the other person you are asking. This is called high performer questions.

### Reading Comprehension

Most info is in texts, improve reading skills, slow down and maintain focus on what you are reading. Go back and reread what you missed. Increase reading capacity so that reading boring texts is easier.

#### Read in order

Read everying and save them as references to read again later. Read more than once. Slow down and focus.

#### Do not take notes

Documentations online are your notes, people wrote them already. No need to rewrite it in your own version. Do not rely 100% on what you write as source of truth. Rely on Google and official docs. Write notes conceptually, collect new info there not documentating.

#### Read first, act later

To never miss anything, read all first so you get the big picture. Then you know what you are trying to do from start to end. You will also know if you did something wrong as you have seen the whole thing before doing it.

#### Videos learning

Watching videos is not easier, it seems easy because you can ignore the video and just copy paste blindly. What you want is to engage your brain at every step, learning style is a myth, This is the summary from this [study about learning style](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/LearningStylesMyth). Just study from reading, that is enough.

No scientific evidence backs this, these are just preferences, they do not make them study better. Learning style is a neuromyth.

Just study from reading.

### Learning Code

Focus on constant improvement rather than perfection.

#### Focus on the assignment

If the focus is to understand concept A, then do not spend extra time working on it if you understood concept A already. This keeps things fresh and you learn more things. Keep going and not stagnant.

#### Run every code

Examples are to be run and played with. Pick it apart and see how it ticks. To the point where you understand 100%. Always test your assumptions and make sure that it is true. That is how you check if you understand it 100% or not. If your assumption is wrong or you did not check your assumptions at all and move on, this creates knowledge holes.

#### Avoid rabbit holes

See the big picture and list down all that is needed to know then pick the ones that you need to know right now and study that instead. You visit the other ones later in the future. This is so that you know what is possible in this topic and what to study next.

#### Plan on macro level

Plan on the big picture first of a project, deal with the detailed problems later on. Never overplan and keep things simple. Code later, plan first.

#### Do not see solution if not done

Struggle and finding out the solution yourself is learning. If you see solution you will not learn problem solving skill and you will not remember it as strong. In real world there is no solutions to cheat from.

#### Read other's code

Spend significant amount of time reading other's code and understand how they think. Read good bad and everything. So that you know the difference of something that is easy and hard to read. Understand what goes in someone's mind, play and tweak their code. Read and review it, know why someone decided to do things in a certain way.

#### Refactor your code

When you are done with your project and looked at other's code. Refactor your code using what you have learned. Spend time using effective things you learned to know why people use it and how it was found. Do not spend too much time on this. Never use something that you do not understand, understand it first before you use it. Do not throw away something entirely instead refactor it.

#### Write your unit tests

This is important, this reduces debugging and makes you professional for potential employer.

#### Use Git

Makes you look pro and easy to share code. Write good commit messages. Here is the [reference](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) to this section. How to write a git commit message.

Here are great commit messages examples:
- [Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master).
- [Git](https://github.com/git/git/commits/main).
- [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commits/main).
- [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/commits/master).

You want to write:
- Consistent lengths.
- Consistent form.
- Concise.

You want to tell *context* about a change. `diff` tells you *what* changed, commit messages tells you `why`. Peter Hutterer [makes this point](http://who-t.blogspot.co.at/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html):

> Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can’t avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it [as much] as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as a result, a commit message shows whether a developer is a good collaborator.

Commit messages are for maintainability, so that anyone understands what happened in the past. **This section covers writing individual commit messages**. Stick to one convention of writing, a convention defines these 3 things:

1. **Style:**  
  Markup syntax, wrap margins, grammar, capitalization, punctuation. Make it simple and easy to read.

2. **Content:**  
   What should the body contain?

3. **Metadata:**  
   How to refer metadata? Pull request number, etc.

There are well-established conventions already, no need to re-invent. Follow the rules below to commit like a pro.

```
Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789
```

The following references are here:
- http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html
- https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines

- https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages
- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/30bce7/CONTRIBUTING.md#format-commit-messages

Here are the rules:

1. **Separate subject from body with a blank line:**  
   From `git commit` manpage:  
   > Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example, Git-format-patch(1) turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.  
   
   A body is not always needed; if one line suffices, then use it, use the `-m` option in `git commit`:
   ```
   $ git commit -m"Fix typo in introduction to user guide"
   
   Fix typo in introduction to user guide
   ```
   Use git `git show`, `git diff` or `git log -p` to see what the fix is.

   Use text editor to write commit messages that has bodies. Use [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration) to set up an editor for use with Git.

   You need to use the blank line between the subject line and body in order for Git to know where the subject line and body are.

   Here is how the commit message with bodies look like when you log it:

   ```
   $ git log
   commit 42e769bdf4894310333942ffc5a15151222a87be
   Author: Kevin Flynn <kevin@flynnsarcade.com>
   Date:   Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 1982 -0200
  
    Derezz the master control program
  
    MCP turned out to be evil and had become intent on world domination.
    This commit throws Tron's disc into MCP (causing its deresolution)
    and turns it back into a chess game.
   ```

   Or show the subject line only

   ```
   $ git log --oneline
   42e769 Derezz the master control program
   ```

   Or show the subject line only for 1 user

   ```
   $ git shortlog
   Kevin Flynn (1):
         Derezz the master control program
  
   Alan Bradley (1):
         Introduce security program "Tron"
  
   Ed Dillinger (3):
         Rename chess program to "MCP"
         Modify chess program
         Upgrade chess program
  
   Walter Gibbs (1):
         Introduce protoype chess program
   ```

2. **Limit the subject line to 50 characters:**  
   50 is not a hard limit, keep subject lines concise around this line for readability:  
   > Tip: If you`re having a hard time summarizing, you might be committing too many changes at once. Strive for [atomic commits](https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/), a topic for a later day.  
   
   GitHub's UI knows this convention and will warn you. It truncates at 72 characters with ellipsis. 72 is the hard limit.

3. **Capitalize the subject line:**  
   Begin all subject lines with capital letter.

4. **Do not end the subject line with a period:**  
   Using a period waste space, you are only given around 50 chars to work with.

5. **Use the imperative mood in the subject line:**  
   Meaning, "spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction":
   - Clean you room
   - Close the door
   - Take out the trash
  
   This is because Git itself uses the *imperative* whenever it creates a commit for you, `git merge` reads:
   ```
   Merge branch `myfeature`
   ```
   And so on. So use imperative to follow Git`s convention:
   - Refactor subsystem X for readability
   - Update getting started documentation
   - Remove deprecated methods
   - Release version 1.0,0
  
   So do not use the *indicative mood* like "Fixed bug with Y". To check if imperative mood is used correctly, follow this rule:

   - If applied, this commit will *your subject line here*

   For example:

   - If applied, this commit will *refactor subsystem X for readability*
     
   > Remember: Use of the imperative is important only in the subject line. You can relax this restriction when you're writing the body.

6. **Wrap the body at 72 characters:**  
   Git does not wrap automatically, you wrap manually.

   You want to wrap at 72 characters. Use a text editor to help you do this, it can help you auto wrap.

7. **Use the body to explain what and why vs how:**  
   This [commit from Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/eb0b56b19017ab5c16c745e6da39c53126924ed6) is a great example of a body:  
   > Tip: If you`re having a hard time summarizing, you might be committing too many changes at once. Strive for [atomic commits](https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/), a topic for a later day.  
   
   A body is not always needed; if one line suffices, then use it, use the `-m` option in `git commit`:
   ```
   commit eb0b56b19017ab5c16c745e6da39c53126924ed6
   Author: Pieter Wuille <pieter.wuille@gmail.com>
   Date:   Fri Aug 1 22:57:55 2014 +0200
  
      Simplify serialize.h's exception handling
  
      Remove the 'state' and 'exceptmask' from serialize.h's stream
      implementations, as well as related methods.
  
      As exceptmask always included 'failbit', and setstate was always
      called with bits = failbit, all it did was immediately raise an
      exception. Get rid of those variables, and replace the setstate
      with direct exception throwing (which also removes some dead
      code).
  
      As a result, good() is never reached after a failure (there are
      only 2 calls, one of which is in tests), and can just be replaced
      by !eof().
  
      fail(), clear(n) and exceptions() are just never called. Delete
      them.
   ```
   Good context saves people from trying to figure out what it is about.

   Most of the time you can leave out the details how changes were made. Code is self-explanatory, code can have comments too for that. So the body should focus on telling why you made the change, how it was before and what is wrong with it and how it is now and why you changed it this way.

##### Love the command line for Git

IDE integration for Git is not as good. Command line has the full power of Git.

##### Read Pro Git

Read [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book, it is free online for free.

#### Strategically building your portfolio

Odin Project provides opportunities to make really good portfolios, not certificates. Focus on non foundation projects for portfolios.

#### Pick projects you like and use them as portfolio fodder

Pick the ones you like for your portfolio. Make it your own and go the extra miles.

#### Always spend extra time on capstone projects

Spend most time on projects at the end for each course. Use it to remind yourself what the course covers.

#### Use git properly

Experimenting, and moving through your histories is super easy with Git. You will use this everyday at work anyways.

### Applying to jobs

This is the goal for most Odinites.

#### Avoid freelancing

Freelancing is very hard without using CMS like Wordpress. Fresh Odin Project graduates are not ready to freelance a real scalable and safe website. You need to learn how to do the extra knowledge first from working at a company. Learning from failures from freelance job is risky as it has lawsuits. Freelancing requires time investment in marketing, financial and other business representatives. Spend time working on becoming a good developer to be hired as a professional instead unless you are already good at running your own business.

#### Don't apply too early

Spend time learning more skills after graduating. Applying when you are not ready has a low chance for getting accepted anywhere. Companies that do accept applicants who are not ready are usually predatory.

#### Check out the getting-hired section when you're ready

Read the getting-hired section here and Discord as you are applying later.

#### Look at already reviewed resumes

Find these in Discord, in the getting-hired channels look for a pin that teaches you how to find reviewed resumes. Or use the search in that channel. Use those as reference for you resume, read the feedbacks and apply it to yours.

#### Ask for a resume review

### Motication and Taking Action

> Action isn't just the effect of motivation, but also the cause of it

People do something when they are motivated, they are motivated when they get emotional inspiration like when you see a pro guitarist. But there is a problem with this framework, because most of the time it is negative emotions are the things that should cause us to take action.

You need to fix your relationship with your mother and the emotional inspirations are hurt and avoidance. That motivates you to not fix it instead of fixing it.

### How to get motivated: the "do something" principle

Motivation is an endless loop, your actions create further emotional reactions that motivates you to your future. So the correct mindset is action first, inspiration next then motivation. So if you need motivation, do something, then use the reaction you get from there to motivate you to do something.

It is found that when people do something, it would motivate them to do something else. Force yourself to do something small, that makes the bigger things seem easier to do.

Success in anything requires more than just knowledge and talent, it needs action. Because without action, you will never be successful at anything.
