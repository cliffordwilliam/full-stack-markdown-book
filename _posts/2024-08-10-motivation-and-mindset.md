## Introduction

To learn anything you need the right mindset, time and effort. Here we discuss the things to do and avoid when studying.

## Motivation

You need motivation to study, it can be anything.

- You need a job.
- You want to make apps.
- You want to start your own company.

Use your motivation to as fuel and end goal for studying.

## Growth mindset

Mindset is key to studying anything. **Fixed mindset** people believe when they fail once, they never will. But research says that intelligence can be developed. **Growth mindset** people believes that with effort and persistence you can learn anything. Does not matter how long you persist, you will make it, that is learning. Always remember your milestones as a proof that it is possible to improve. Some people do it faster and some does it slower, it does not matter, this is because we all have different backgrounds and ways of thinking. Some are better suited for detailed oriented sort of thinking while others are more abstract and so on.

## The learning process

The best way to learn is to apply new concept into practice in form of projects. This ensures that your understanding is correct and is aligned to reality.

When learning, your mind will constantly switch between focus mode and diffuse mode. **Focus mode** is when you do stretch your brain in deliberate learning. **Diffuse mode** is when your brain connects neuron in your brain when you are relaxing, which result in learning new knowledge. It is similar to exercising, you lift weigh that causes your muscle to break, you rest and lets it heal, then your muscle recover stronger. So when you are at your limit maximum effort, take breaks.

Then lastly, to test your understanding, go and teach someone this new thing you just learned. This will reveal knowledge holes that you missed.

## What to do when you`re stuck

Here are tips when you are really stuck:

- **Google it:**  
  The reason is because it is very likely that whatever problem you are facing now, someone had solved it in the past.

- **Take a break:**  
  Enter diffuse mode and let your brain heal.

- **Ask for help in the [TOP Discord server](https://discord.gg/theodinproject):**  
  Or ask anyone else online about it. The next lesson will show you how to ask question effectively and properly so read that first.

## A note on AI code generation

Today we have Large Language Models and generative AIs. Github Copilot code completion and ChatGPT code generation. Beginners should avoid this as it creates huge knowledge holes, those who already understand how to program and just wants an assistant to help them write should use this. David Humphrey, a computer science professor, [wrote about ChatGPT and its potentially negative impacts on core learning](https://blog.humphd.org/cheatgpt/).

Pitfalls for beginners:

1. You do not get to learn how your code works under the hood.
2. Missed out practicing asking good questions.
3. Missed out practicing about talking about your code, this is needed at work for code reviews.
4. You do not know what is good and bad code. Text from LLMs needs to be reviewed closely, they can hallucinate.
5. Writing good prompts is not a core skill of a web developer.
6. LLM purpose is to provide answer, not teach you (for now).
7. With all the above, interviews will be a struggle. Interviews will not let you use AI tools.

## Managing your study time

Daily consistency is key, even if you do it 1 hour a day. Do not make deadlines for yourself, do not rush and instead go at your own pace and spend enough time to understand something completely before moving on, or you will have knowledge holes and be a poor web developer.

## Pitfalls to avoid

Here are some pitfalls and how to avoid them:

- **Procrastination:**  
  Do [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Study and do not get distracted for 25 minutes, if you fail, restart that 25 minutes. If you succeed, take 5 minutes break. Then repeat. After 4 reps take 15 minutes break. This forces you to work and not procrastinante, since 25 minutes is a very short time to focus and learn.

- **Not taking breaks:**  
  Pushing yourself too hard leads to burnout. You instead get more done with regular breaks. Studies show that performance increase after breaks of all duration. John Trougakos, Associate Professor of Management at the University of Toronto, says concentration is like a muscle. Focus gets fatigue and needs rest. During breaks you can:
  - Listen to music.
  - Journal.
  - Meditate.
  - Play a quick game.
  - Go for a walk.

- **Digital distractions:**  
  Social medias are time waster, they break focus and causes procrastination. So turn them off.

- **Physical distractions:**  
  TV in background or people talking does the same damage as above. Find a quiet place to study.

- **Rabbit holes:**  
  Do not spend too much time to learn them all. Learn what you need, take note of what is there to learn for later when you need it. Rabbit holes causes burnout and destroys momentum.
  
- **Comparing yourself to others:**  
  Who cares where others are, compare yourself to your past, what matters is if you are now better than yesterday.

- **Counterproductive note-taking:**  
  Do not take notes as all notes you need have been written online. Instead write the resources name that you need so that you can visit them later online when you need it. Or notes on learning to do list.
